This portfolio website ("joho's studio") is a personal creative portfolio showcasing multimedia projects across multiple pages including a homepage with project listings, 12 individual project pages, an about page, gallery, and a music recommendations page. The site was built as a lightweight, static website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build process or framework dependencies. The architecture consists of standalone HTML files for each page, making deployment as simple as uploading files to a web server. Styling uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid development, combined with custom CSS for animations, page transitions, and responsive design. Interactive features are implemented with vanilla JavaScript: glitch.js creates a hover effect where roman numerals transform into words through randomized character animation, page-transitions.js handles smooth fade/slide animations between pages, and postcards-carousel.js manages a YouTube video carousel with touch/swipe navigation. The project structure is intentionally flat—no framework overhead, no bundlers, just direct HTML/CSS/JS files that can be edited and deployed immediately. This approach prioritizes simplicity, quick iterations, and direct control over the codebase, which aligns well with a personal portfolio where rapid edits and code transparency are more valuable than the scalability benefits of a modern framework.

If I were to edit this project, I would consolidate the architecture by removing the unused Next.js app in the home/home subdirectory and committing fully to either static HTML or migrating to a framework like Next.js. I would implement a build process using PostCSS to optimize Tailwind CSS, add minification for assets, and set up image optimization. Instead of duplicating HTML across 12+ project pages, I would create reusable components or templates to reduce maintenance overhead. I would migrate the custom JavaScript scripts to TypeScript for type safety, introduce a JSON data file for content management to make adding projects easier, and implement performance optimizations like lazy loading and code splitting. I would also improve accessibility with better ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support. The current approach works well for a personal portfolio where simplicity and quick edits are priorities, but these changes would make it more scalable and maintainable as the project grows.
